Subject: Application – Fullstack Developer / Software Architect – Specialized in Application Security & Azure
Remote-first with planned relocation to Latin America

Dear Recruitment Team,

With more than 25 years of experience in backend development, cloud architecture and application security, 
I am applying for a role as a backend developer/devSecOps or Azure Security architect. 
I currently live in France and am actively planning to relocate to Latin America. 
I am available immediately for a fully remote collaboration, with a high level of autonomy and efficiency, while preparing for relocation.

My main focus lies in backend systems (.NET, REST APIs, microservices, performance, scalability), 
with strong experience designing secure cloud-native solutions on Microsoft Azure (App Services, Security, DevOps). 
I apply DevSecOps principles from the design stage and have worked with international teams on regulated, business-critical systems.

I am a native French speaker, fluent in Spanish, and have professional proficiency in English, 
making me highly adaptable in multilingual and multicultural environments.

I’m looking to join a forward-thinking company open to high-level remote profiles, 
with a clear perspective of long-term relocation to Latin America.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and would be glad to discuss how I can contribute to your technical success.

Sincerely,

Stéphane Belkheraz
